# Python Scripts - Project Folder

## Description

This folder contains Python scripts that demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as:
- Importing and using functions from external files
- Handling arguments passed to scripts
- Performing basic mathematical operations
- Discovering hidden attributes and variables from compiled modules

*All scripts are executable, start with the shebbang '#!/usr/bin/python3',
and are intended to be run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using Python 3.10.\*.
All code follows PEP8 style guidelines checked with 'pycodestyle' 2.7.\*.*

| '3-infinite_add.py' | Prints the result of the addition of all arguments. | ./3-print_alphabt.py |
| '4-hidden_discovery.py' | Prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc | ./3-hidden_discovery.py|
