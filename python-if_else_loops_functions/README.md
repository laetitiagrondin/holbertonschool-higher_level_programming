# Python Scripts - Project Folder

## Description
This folder contains Python scripts that demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as:
- Conditional statements (e.g., checking if numbers are positive or negative)
- String manipulation (e.g., printing alphabets, uppercasing text)
- Basic mathematical operations (e.g., addition, power calculation)
- Iteration and combination logic (e.g., printing sequences, FizzBuzz)
These scripts are intended for beginner-level practice, focusing on:
- Understanding how to work with variables and data types
- Implementing simple algorithms and logic
- Mastering the basics of Python syntax

*All scripts are executable, start with the shebbang '#!/usr/bin/python3',
and are intended to be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.\*.
All code follows PEP8 style guidelines checked with 'pycodestyle' 2.7.\*.*

## Contraints
- All files **must be executable** ('chmod +x filename.py')
- All files **end with a new line**
- The first line of every file must be exactly: **#!/usr/bin/python3**
